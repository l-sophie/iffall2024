        <h2>Cigarettes After Sex</h2>
        
        <div class="lyrics">
            <p>You leapt from crumbling bridges</p>
            <p>Watching cityscapes turn to dust</p>
            <br>
            <p>Filming helicopters crashing</p>
            <p>In the ocean from way above</p>
            <br>
            <p>Got the music in you,baby</p>
            <p>Tell me why</p>
            <p>Got the music in you,baby</p>
            <p>Tell me why</p>
            <p>You've been locked in here forever</p>
            <p>And you just can't say goodbye</p>
            <br>
            <p>Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers</p>
            <p>Wrapped in your arms</p>
            <br>
            <p>You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos</p>
            <p>Left in the dark</p>
            <br>
            <p>Got the music in you,baby</p>
            <p>Tell me why</p>
            <p>Got the music in you,baby</p>
            <p>Tell me why</p>
            <p>You've been locked in here forever</p>
            <p>And you just can't say goodbye</p>
            <br>
            <p>Your lips, my lips</p>
            <p>Apocalypse</p>
            <br>
            <p>Your lips, my lips</p>
            <p>Apocalypse</p>
            <br>
            <p>Go and sneak us through the rivers</p>
            <p>Flood is rising up on your knees</p>
            <p>Oh, please</p>
            <p>Come out and haunt me</p>
            <p>I know you want me</p>
            <p>Come out and haunt me</p>
            <br>
            <p>Sharing all your secrets with each other</p>
            <p>Since you were kids</p>
            <br>
            <p>Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you</p>
            <p>Clutched in your fist</p>
            <br>
            <p>Got the music in you,baby</p>
            <p>Tell me why</p>
            <p>Got the music in you,baby</p>
            <p>Tell me why</p>
            <p>You've been locked in here forever</p>
            <p>And you just can't say goodbye</p>
            <br>
            <p>You've been locked in here forever</p>
            <p>And you just can't say goodbye</p>
            <br>
            <p>Ooh, oh</p>
            <p>When you're all alone</p>
            <p>I'll reach for you</p>
            <p>When you're feelin' low</p>
            <p>I'll be there too</p>
